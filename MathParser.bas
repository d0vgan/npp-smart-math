'  With 1, `f(x)=1%(x-1)` can fail (again, mode 0).
'  When this define is enabled, each formal parameter is given the value

'  seeding x during validation when a global variable shares a formal name.
'  A name is either a user function or a variable: defining f(...) removes variable f;
'  assigning to x removes user function x (see SetUserFunction / assignment path).
